ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @h3hamilton

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning more about GitHub, specifically GitHub Actions and api hooks to integrate github into our workflows via slack, jira, etc.


I'm looking to hire someone that is enthusiastic about building out GitHub at global company with many studios and use cases.  We need a "github guru"- so if you know of anyone (yourself included!) that would be interested, ping me!
